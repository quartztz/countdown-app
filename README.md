# countdown-app
Quick Project to familiarize with Vanilla js, HTML and CSS. Not sure this will go anywhere as-is, but I might use it as a template if it goes well enough.

## IMPLEMENTED
Already implemented features include: 
 - a functioning ui: shows the (correctly formatted) time between the current time and a user set date. Also works with multiple end dates and multiple timers.; 
 - a scuffed way to have a background image;

## TODO

todos include: 

	- Actual Countdown implementation: 

	[x] Figure out how to get the time between two dates;

	[x] Figure out how to display it in the "DAYS|HOURS|MINUTES|SECONDS" format I've chosen.

	- Multiple countdowns:

	[x] Implement dynamic HTML generation on the js end;
	
	[ ] Implement a button with an accompaning ui so the user can add new countdowns straight from the website.

	- UI: 

	[ ] Fix the Background Image;
	[ ] Add (option to?) blur background image;
	[ ] Add "New Countdown" button.
