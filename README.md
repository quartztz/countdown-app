# countdown-app
Quick Project to familiarize with Vanilla js, HTML and CSS. Not sure this will go anywhere as-is, but I might use it as a template if it goes well enough.

## implemented
Already implemented features include: 
 - a somewhat functioning ui; 
 - a scuffed way to have a background image;

## TODO

todos include: 

 - Actual Countdown implementation: 

 [ ] Figure out how to get the time between two dates;
 [ ] Figure out how to display it in the "DAYS|HOURS|MINUTES|SECONDS" format I've chosen.

 - Multiple countdowns:

 [x] Implement dynamic HTML generation on the js end;
 [ ] Implement a button with an accompaning ui so the user can add new countdowns straight from the website.
