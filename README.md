# countdown-app
Quick Project to familiarize with Vanilla js, HTML and CSS. Not sure this will go anywhere as-is, but I might use it as a template if it goes well enough.

### IMPLEMENTED
Already implemented features include: 
 - a functioning ui: shows the (correctly formatted) time between the current time and a user set date. Also works with multiple end dates and multiple timers;
 - ability to add new countdowns through a "plus" button at the top of the screen; when pressed, opens a popup where the user can add a title and an end date;
 - a scuffed way to have a background image;

### TODO

todos include: 

	- Actual Countdown implementation: 

	[x] Figure out how to get the time between two dates;

	[x] Figure out how to display it in the "DAYS|HOURS|MINUTES|SECONDS" format I've chosen.

	- Multiple countdowns:

	[x] Implement dynamic HTML generation on the js end;
	
	[x] Implement a button with an accompaning ui so the user can add new countdowns straight from 
	the website.

	- UI: 

	[x] Change display mode for expired countdowns (currently, a color change to a shade of red, 
	and the replacement of the "D|H|M|S" display with a message and the original endDate);

	[/] More readable UI on mobile devices;

	[ ] Fix the Background Image;

	[ ] Add (option to?) blur background image;

	- Save Session: 

	[ ] In the very far future: be able to save your configuration of preferred countdowns, and 
	actually open those on startup.
